# Pokédex
You can see what it actually looks like here:

My backend Pokédex-like API is functioning, and the frontend is currently retrieving all Pokémon from the database. I need to populate my database with more Pokémon and add additional details and information to each one.
It's pretty okay, I guess, at least for now...
